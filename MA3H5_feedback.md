# MA3H5 Manifolds: rRsponse to Initial Feedback

8 students completed the questionnaire: thank you if you did!

I am going to comment only on the question where the answer was not a unanimous approval.

## Handwriting
At least one person does not find my handwriting readable.  I will try to write clearer, but since this is how I usually write, I may not be too successful.  Please, do interrupt me during the lectures if you want me to have a second shot at writing some words!

## Rate of delivery
Between just right with a few thinking that it is too fast.  Hopefully, the rate of delivery will appear slower, now that the ratio between new tools and old tricks will shift in favour of "old tricks".  Again, asking questions during the lectures will slow me down and may help clearing out doubts.

## Following the discussions in the lectures
Most of you are ok with this, but not all.  This is another situation where asking questions could probably help.  Unless you already asked a question and I did not clarify your doubts.  If this is the case, then do approach me after the lectures/in the break and I can try to give further help.

## Module is well organized
This is an even split.  If you have some specific idea to make it better, I am happy to hear it.    Personally, I am a little surprised by this result.  I thought that following the lecture notes, maintaining an up-to-date syllabus with the material covered and the coordination with the support classes was all working together well.  Since it seems that a good number of you disagree with this assessment, I would be particularly curious to know what I could do to improve your perception.

## Assessment for the module
One person answered that they are not aware of this.  The only assessment is the final exam.  The dates for the final exam are released centrally by the university.

## Overall satisfaction
Please, let me know if there is something that I can do to improve your experience with this module!

## Open-ended comments.
These are harder to address, as they point in opposite directions.

I will write more on the boards, as this seems to be helpful to some.

Regarding the exam: the format will follow closely the style of past exams.
