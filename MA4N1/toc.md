##  Assessment

The assessment for the module is 100% coursework, based on group projects.

Two submissions are during Term 1.

The final submission is at the end of January, in Term 2.

You can find some ideas for what might constitute a "toy project" [here](ideas_to_develop).

The module is based on the proof assistant [Lean 4](https://lean-lang.org/).
We will use [Mathlib](https://leanprover-community.github.io/), the mathematical library of Lean 4.

You can find ways to interact with Lean and Mathlib on the [Mathlib webpage](https://leanprover-community.github.io/).

#### Note: `Lean 3` vs `Lean 4`
Lean 4 is the latest version of Lean.
Switching from Lean 3 to Lean 4 means rewriting all the code, all the supporting information and all the webpages.
This process is completed for `Mathlib`, however there are still online resources that talk about Lean and mean Lean 3.
In this module, we will only work with Lean 4.
