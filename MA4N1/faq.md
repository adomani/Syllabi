##  Asking questions

The [Mathlib Zulip chat](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/) is an excellent place to ask questions about formalization of mathematics in Lean.
There is a very clear explanation of what constitutes a "good question".
This is the notion of a [minimal working example](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mwe.html), or [#mwe](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mwe.html), for short.

This is a very effective way of getting answers.
Please read the text at link above.
Formalizing mathematics is very explicit about making everything very precise.
The same precision is expected for questions!
The more you can isolate what your issue is and the more you provide all the surrounding context, the easier it will be to address your specific issue and get on with your project!

Please, take [#mwe](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mwe.html)s seriously!

Also, feel free to use the [Zulip chat](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/) mentioned above.
