#  Stubs of ideas and projects

###  Mathematically oriented projects

* Sums of squares of a field are a group with zero
* The non-zero sums of squares of a field form a multiplicative group
* Derivatives of polynomials are continuous
* In a semiring, 0 is odd if and only if 2 has a multiplicative inverse and 1 has an additive opposite
* Characterise semirings in which 1 is even
* Sums and products of continuous functions are continuous
* Polynomials over an integral domain are an integral domain
* Irrational numbers exist
* Find infinite subsets of the natural numbers containing no 3-term arithmetic progression
* Your favourite theorem!

Besides using Lean to prove theorems, you can also use it to verify counterexamples!
Two books that contain lots of inspiration are
* [Counterexamples in Topology](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9),
* [Counterexamples in Analysis](https://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/sites/default/files/_olmsted_1.pdf).

###  Computer science oriented projects

* Automating proofs:
  * write a tactic to dispatch "junk values"
  * write a tactic to compute degrees of multivariate polynomials
  * write a tactic to split and progress on `Nat.sub`
* Tooling for statistical analysis of Mathlib:
  * proof lengths (extract the number of lines of the proofs of all declarations)
  * tactic in a declaration (find which tactics are used in a given declaration)
  * tactic usage (frequency distribution of tactics)
  * finishing tactics (frequency distribution of the last tactic in a proof)
* Come up with your meta-programming goal!
