###  More mathematics-oriented

* Sums of squares of a field are a group with zero
* The non-zero sums of squares of a field form a multiplicative group
* Derivatives of polynomials are continuous
* In a semiring, 0 is odd if and only if 2 has a multiplicative inverse and 1 has an additive opposite
* Characterise semirings in which 1 is even
* Sums and products of continuous functions are continuous
* Polynomials over an integral domain are an integral domain
* Irrational numbers exist
* Find infinite subsets of the natural numbers containing no 3-term arithmetic progression
* Your favourite theorem!

###  More computer science-oriented

* Tooling for statistical analysis of Mathlib:
  * proof lengths (extract the number of lines of the proofs of all declarations)
  * tactic usage (frequency distribution of tactics)
  * finishing tactics (frequency distribution of the last tactic in a proof)
* Automating proofs
  * write a tactic to dispatch "junk values"
  * write a tactic to compute degrees of multivariate polynomials
  * write a tactic to split and progress on `Nat.sub`
* Come up with your meta-programming goal!
