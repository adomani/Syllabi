# MA3J9 Historical Challenges in Mathematics
##  Autumn 2022

### Syllabus

Week 1:
* Pre-recorded: Statement and proof of Wallace-Bolyai-Gerwien Theorem.
* Tuesday: Overview of Hilbert's problems and specifically Hilbert's 3rd problem.  Initial introduction to tensor products.
* Thursday: Tensor products.

Week 2:
* Pre-recorded:
rotation group, $\mathbb{R} \otimes S^1$
 Difference between the free abelian group on ordered pairs and the tensor product.
* Tuesday: $\mathbb{Z}/2 \otimes \mathbb{Z}/3$ and $\mathbb{Z} \otimes A$ -- examples that can be computed "directly".

  $\mathbb{Z}/a \otimes \mathbb{Z}/b$ -- an example computed via the universal property.
* Thursday: Definition of the Dehn invariant.

  Torsion subgroup $\mathbb{R} \otimes 2\pi \mathbb{Q}/2\pi\mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{R} \otimes \mathbb{R}/2\pi\mathbb{Z}$.

Week 3:
* Pre-recorded:
invariance of the Dehn invariant under scissor congruence.

  Rotation group, $\mathbb{R} \otimes S^1$, polyhedra, definition of the Dehn invariant.
* Tuesday: Tensor product of $\mathbb{R}$ with rotations by a rational multiple of $\pi$, $\mathbb{R} \otimes \mathbb{Z}$.
* Thursday: Computation of the Dehn invariant for the cube and, partially, for the regular tetrahedron.

Week 4:
invariance of the Dehn invariant under scissor congruence, answer to Hilbert's Third problem.
Wednesday: computation of the dihedral angles of a regular tetrahedron.  Contribution to the Dehn invariant of some of the edges created by cutting a polyhedron by a plane. Ingredients for computing Dehn invariants.
Friday: final part of invariance and answer to Hilbert's 3rd problem -- the unit cube and the regular tetrahedron of unit volume are not scissor congruent.  More on tensor products.

Week 5:
overview of Hilbert's 17th problem. Formally real fields, preorders, orders, initial properties. Artin-Schreier Theorem. [To be discussed in the live events: Orders and order relations, totally positive elements. Orders on quadratic fields].
Wednesday: Hilbert's 17th problem, Motzkin's example, formally real fields and fields of rational functions.  Sums of squares.
Friday: order relations on fields, orders on real quadratic extensions of Q.

Week 6:
Q&A during breather week.
Wednesday: discussed questions about tensor products and free abelian groups.
Friday: computations with Dehn invariants and with tensor products.

Week 7:
orders and the Artin-Lang homomorphism theorem (statement only).
Wednesday: Artin-Schreier Theorem, totally positive elements, orders on quadratic fields.
Friday: extending a formally real field by adding square roots of elements in a preorder.  Artin-Lang homomorphism implies a positive answer to Hilbert's 17th problem.

Week 8:
Hilbert's 10th problem, Diophantine equations, Diophantine sets, algorithms, listability, non-listability.  Algorithmic equivalence of solving Diophantine equations over the integers or over the natural number.
Wednesday: introduction to Hilbert's 10th problem, Diophantine equations, converting a Diophantine equation into an algorithm.
Friday: Diophantine sets, listable sets, statement of the Davis-Putnam-Robinson-Matiyasevich Theorem.

Week 9:
examples of listable sets with non-listable complements.
Wednesday: Diophantine equations for less-than-or-equal, divisibility, and, or, min.
Friday: Putnam's trick.  Using equivalence of Diophantine and listable to resolve Hilbert's 10th problem.

Week 10:
undecidability of Hilbert's 10th problem, Rule 110 and cellular automata.
Wednesday: GÃ¶del's Theorem from the perspective of Hilbert's 10th problem, more undecidability.
Friday: examples of composite numbers and non-powers of two as Diophantine sets.  Discussion about their complements being Diophantine.
