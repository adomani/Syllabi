# MA3J9 Historical Challenges in Mathematics: Response to Initial Feedback

13 students completed the questionnaire: thank you if you did!

I am going to comment only on the question where the answer was not a unanimous approval.

## Handwriting
At least one person does not find my handwriting readable.  I will try to write clearer, but since this is how I usually write, I may not be too successful.  Please, do interrupt me during the lectures if you want me to have a second shot at writing some words!

## Rate of delivery
9 "just right", 2 "too slow" and 2 "too fast".
This is a tough one, although it seems that continuing with the current pace is probably best.

## Following the discussions in the lectures
One of you is not ok with this.  This is another situation where asking questions could probably help.  Unless you already asked a question and I did not clarify your doubts.  If this is the case, then do approach me after the lectures and I can try to give further help.

## Module is well organized
One of you thinks not.
If you have any specific comments, I am happy to hear them!

## Pre-requisite and background knowledge
This is available from the [Undergraduate Handbook page for the module](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/currentstudents/ughandbook/year3/ma3j9/).

## Textbook and resources
These are available from the Moodle page of the module, in the folder called ["Lecture notes"](https://moodle.warwick.ac.uk/mod/folder/view.php?id=1885278).

## Support classes
This module does not have support classes.

## Overall satisfaction
* Quizzes.
  I have now posted the second quiz.
  The third will be due in a few weeks, since it will cover Hilbert's 10th problem.
  The final quiz is going to be a summary of the previous 3: I will make it available soon, although only the parts that relate to the material already covered will be accessible.

* Cohesion of the lectures: hopefully, now that we finished Hilbert's 3rd problem, the lectures appear more structured.
  I try to make the pre-recorded material and the live lectures independent, so that they can be watched/attended in whichever order.
  This means that they sometimes talk about different strands of the material, and only tie in together towards the end.

* Handwriting: I will try to make my handwriting more legible, but do interrupt me to read over what I wrote, if you cannot make sense of it.

Finally, I am glad about all the positive comments that I read!
