Dear Students,

here is a summary of the actions taken as a consequence of the Initial Module Evaluation.

* By far, the largest number of comments was about help with forming groups:
  I dedicated a few lectures and parts of others to help focus on topics and creating groups.
* Changed the colour scheme of VSCode: now it is dark.

With respect to the pace of the module, the majority of answers is "Just right" and the next most frequent is "Too fast" (2 answers) and finally "Too slow" (1 answer).
I will leave this unchanged.

Thank you all for taking the time to give me feedback!  I hope that your experience with the module improves as a consequence of the changes!

If you have more comments, feel free to let me know.

Best wishes,
Damiano
